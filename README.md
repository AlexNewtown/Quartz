# Quartz

&copy; 2018 - 2019 Micha≈Ç Siejak ([@Nadrin](https://twitter.com/Nadrin))

A physically based GPU path tracing renderer with a declarative scene description language based on ES7.

Powered by Qt 3D, NVIDIA RTX & Vulkan.

## Current release

* [Quartz Standalone Renderer - Windows 64bit](https://github.com/Nadrin/Quartz/releases/download/v1.0.0/quartz_1.0.0_win64.zip) [version 1.0.0]
* [Example 3D scenes](https://github.com/Nadrin/Quartz/releases/download/v1.0.0/quartz_scenes.zip)

## Overview

Quartz consists of several components:

* At its core is a raytracing aspect for [Qt 3D](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qt3d-index.html) implemented by the `Qt3DRaytrace` module. It provides both C++ and [QML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QML) APIs for use in Qt 3D based applications and is a drop-in replacement for `Qt3DRender` (rasterization-based rendering aspect). While not (yet) on par with `Qt3DRender` feature set, many `Qt3DRaytrace` types are named the same and provide similar functionality, thus making the two aspects somewhat analogous.
* A standalone renderer application that can load and render arbitrary scenes in Qt 3D [QML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QML) format. It provides live, progressive preview and can save to many LDR and HDR image formats.
* An "extras" module (`Qt3DRaytraceExtras`) providing a set of prebuilt elements and various auxiliary utilities.
* A command-line tool for assisting in conversion of complex 3D scenes to QML-defined hierarchies (`scene2qml`).

## System requirements

Quartz requires a NVIDIA GPU with support for the following Vulkan extensions:

- `VK_KHR_swapchain`
- `VK_NV_ray_tracing`
- `VK_EXT_descriptor_indexing`

## Usage

To use the standalone renderer run `Quartz.exe` (or `./quartz`, on Linux) and select a QML scene file in the open file dialog. Alternatively you can use the command line:

```
Quartz.exe [-x <viewport_width>] [-y <viewport_height>] [path_to_qml_file]
```

If the opened QML file contains an instance of `FirstPersonCameraController` the camera can be controlled interactively. Press and hold either left or right mouse button and drag the mouse around to rotate the view. Use the usual `W`, `S`, `A`, and `D` for movement. `Q` and `E` move up and down respectively.

Press `F2` to save an output image file. Saving to HDR (Radiance) format writes a raw floating-point image in linear space. Saving to any other format writes a tone-mapped, gamma corrected image.

### QML scene description language

QML is a declarative language based on ES7, used by Qt 3D (and thus Quartz) to describe scene hierarchy and all required resources like textures and triangle meshes.

Each QML file consists of a root `Entity` and any number of child nodes, which themselves can also contain child nodes (thus forming a DAG). In most cases a `Node` is either an `Entity` or a `Component`. Entities can contain a number of components (but no more than one component of each type). Examples of components include: `Transform`, `Material`, and `Mesh`.

Every node type exposes some number of properties. A property can be bound to a simple value like `42`, a node instance, or to an arbitrary JavaScript expression. The `id` property is special and uniquely identifies an instance of a node.

### "Hello, World" in Quartz QML

Proper documentation of Quartz QML types is still in the oven. In the meantime here's a simple QML scene to serve as an example:

```qml
import QtQuick 2.0
import Qt3D.Core 2.0
import Qt3D.Raytrace 1.0

Entity {
    id: root
    components: [
        RenderSettings {
            camera: camera
            skyColor: "#00C5FF"
            skyIntensity: 1
        }
    ]
    Camera {
        id: camera
        position: Qt.vector3d(0, 0, 2.6)
        exposure: 1.0
        fieldOfView: 60
    }
    Entity {
        Transform {
            id: sunTransform
            rotationX: 60
            rotationY: -15
            rotationZ: 35
        }
        DistantLight {
            id: sunLight
            color: Qt3DRaytrace.lrgba(1.0, 0.9, 0.8)
            intensity: 5
        }
        components: [ sunTransform, sunLight ]
    }
    Entity {
        Transform {
            id: monkeyTransform
            translation: Qt.vector3d(-0.1, 0, 0)
            rotationY: -30
        }
        Material {
            id: monkeyMaterial
            albedo: "crimson"
            roughness: 0.5
        }
        Mesh {
            id: monkeyMesh
            source: "monkey.obj"
        }
        components: [ monkeyTransform, monkeyMaterial, monkeyMesh ]
    }
}
```

### Note on colors

Since Qt has no notion of color spaces, all color values are assumed to be in sRGB by default. To specify linear color use the `Qt3DRaytrace.lrgba()` function.

For symmetry there's also `Qt3DRaytrace.srgba()` which is equivalent to `Qt.rgba()`.

### Loading 3D models

Quartz uses [Assimp](http://www.assimp.org/) for importing 3D models and thus supports many common file formats, including: Wavefront (OBJ), Autodesk FBX, Collada (DAE), glTF, and others.

Note that `Mesh` component treats its source file as if containing a single 3D object. Multiple objects are pre-transformed and joined into one during import.

To work with complex 3D scenes use the `scene2qml` tool. It converts an input scene file into QML-defined `Entity` hierarchy and extracts individual meshes, and textures into separate files. The resulting QML file can then be imported by using the [`EntityLoader`](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qml-qt3d-core-entityloader.html) node.

Conversion quality depends on the input file format and complexity of a particular scene. The resulting QML file can be further edited by hand to supplement certain information, like some `Material` attributes.

## Building

### Prerequisites

- [Qt 5.12+ SDK](https://www.qt.io/download-qt-installer)
- [Assimp 4.1 SDK](https://github.com/assimp/assimp/releases/tag/v4.1.0/)
- [Khronos Vulkan SDK](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/sdk/home) 1.1.92 or newer
- CMake 3.8 or newer
- Python 3.5 or newer
- pkg-config (on Linux)

### Environment setup

Variable | Description | Example value
---------|-------------|--------------
`QTDIR` | Path to Qt 5.12 headers & libraries | `C:\Qt\5.12.0\msvc2017_64`
`VULKAN_SDK` | Path to Khronos Vulkan SDK (Windows only) | `C:\VulkanSDK\1.1.97.0`
`ASSIMP_ROOT_DIR` | Path to Assimp SDK (Windows only) | `C:\Program Files\Assimp`

### Steps to build

1. Compile GLSL shaders to SPIR-V by running: `src\raytrace\renderers\vulkan\shaders\compile.py`.
2. Configure & build the project using the top level `CMakeLists.txt` file.

**Note for Linux:** Make sure that the version of Qt being used ships with Vulkan support enabled at compile time. Official Qt binaries for Linux support Vulkan since version **5.13**.

### Running development builds

Before you run anything make sure that `QML2_IMPORT_PATH` is configured to look for Quartz QML plugin binaries.

On Windows, also make sure that respective directories containing `Qt53DRaytrace.dll` and `Qt53DRaytraceExtras.dll` are both in `PATH`.
